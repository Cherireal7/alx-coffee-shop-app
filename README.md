üîç Development Process
Step 1: UI Layout
Translated Figma designs into React Native components.

Built Home, Favorites, Order, and Product Details screens.

Step 2: Data Management
Created data.ts to hold coffee products.

Used imageMap.ts to resolve dynamic images for product cards.

Step 3: Navigation
Implemented Tab Navigation with expo-router.

Added stack routing for ProductDetail and DeliveryTracking pages.

Step 4: Delivery Tracking
Integrated react-native-maps.

Implemented live location updates using expo-location and watchPositionAsync.

Added courier info and a "Call Courier" button.

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Solutions
1. Dynamic Image Loading Issue
Problem: require() doesn't support dynamic strings.

Solution: Created a mapping file (imageMap.ts) with static require paths.

2. Safe Area White Gaps
Problem: White gaps appeared due to device notches.

Solution: Used SafeAreaProvider and useSafeAreaInsets to ensure proper padding.

3. Map Centering & Region Control
Problem: The map would not re-center on user location.

Solution: Switched from initialRegion to controlled region state.

üå± Future Improvements
Add a Cart & Checkout flow.

Backend integration (Firebase or Supabase).

Push notifications for order updates.

More animations (fade-in cards, transitions).

Persistent favorites using AsyncStorage.
